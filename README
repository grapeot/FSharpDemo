This is some demo f# code for my blog post http://grapeot.me/post/2012/05/16/Computing-F-revisited.aspx

The function of turtle.fs is to implement a turtle graphics system, and draw some fractural shape on it.

Mandelbrot.fs draws the Mandelbrot set z = z ^ 2 + c with asynchronous and parallel computing enabled in f#.
